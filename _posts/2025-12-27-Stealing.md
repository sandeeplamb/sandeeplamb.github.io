Theft isn't just about objects. We steal personalities too.

Society punishes material theft but ignores identity theft of the soul.

Material abundance may someday end object theft. Personality theft? Never.

When you steal personalities, you change yourself—subtly, daily, relentlessly. Over time, you transform so completely you no longer recognize who you are.

Don't steal. Stay authentic. Be unapologetically yourself.

An actor once said: "I am at ease in a role. When it ends, I don't know who I am."

Don't live as a character. Live as yourself.
